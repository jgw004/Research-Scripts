Programmatic-Scripts
=
üß¨ This repository holds a sample of scripts that I wrote for the purpose of helping me and my lab mates (at the Moradi Lab, University of Arkansas https://bslgroup.hosted.uark.edu/).  The lab is a computational-biophysics lab focusing on the molecular dynamics (MD) of viral components such as the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (my area) and HIV-1 Envelope Glycoprotein along with other lipids and proteins.<br><br>

üõ†Ô∏è Due to ongoing projects, I can't share many of my scripts related to the analysis methods in my project (distance, density, PCA, smFRET, etc.) until the completion and publication of those particular projects. I believe that the programmatic workflow of these scripts can be taken and applied to other coding projects as well!<br><br>

üëâ The scripts under this repo have helped me with creating *directories* and there *subdirectories*, *fast checking* of active/inactive simulation process, pulling *vital information* from desired files, *changing* and *running* all necessary files at once, as well as other day-to-day processes over the terminal (local and/or remote).<br><br>

ü§ù Please, feel free to reach out to me [[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-williamson-373359107/)] with any constructive critiques or curiousities about my scripts/work! Due to ongoing projects, I may have to refrain from answering certain aspects due to confidentiality, but it doesn't hurt to ask! (:
