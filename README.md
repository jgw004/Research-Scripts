# Research-Scripts
üß¨ This repository holds a sample of scripts that I wrote for the purpose of helping me and my lab mates (at the Moradi Lab, University of Arkansas https://bslgroup.hosted.uark.edu/).  The lab is a computational-biophysics lab focusing on the molecular dynamics (MD) of viral components such as the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (my area) and HIV-1 Envelope Glycoprotein along with other lipids and proteins.

‚ôΩ Due to ongoing projects, I won't be sharing the scripts to many of my analysis methods (distance, density, PCA, smFRET, etc.) until the completion and publication of those particular projects. However, I WILL be sharing the scripts I made to help day-to-day processes in the terminal (local and remote) because I believe that the programmatic workflow of these scripts can be taken and applied to other coding projects as well!

ü§ù Please, feel free to reach out to me with any constructive critiques or curiousities about my scripts/work! Due to ongoing projects, I may have to refrain from answering certain aspects due to confidentiality, but it doesn't hurt to try! (:
